The purpose of this analysis is to show the relationship between city types and various ride-sharing indices, in order to develop better strategy and deliver better ride-sharing service.

## Results

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
The ride sharing data showed that Pyber is the most popular in urban cities and the least popular in rural cities. The data frame below showed the summary of ride sharing data from 2019-01-01 to 2019-05-08. As shown in the data frame, urban, suburban and rural cities have 1625, 625 and 125 rides in total in that time period of time. Urban cities also have the highest number of drivers and the most fares, while rural cities have the least. Although urban cities have the most total fares, the average fare per ride in urban cities is lower than that for suburban and rural cities, and the rural cities have the highest average fare per ride. The average fare per driver has the same trend with the average fare per ride.
