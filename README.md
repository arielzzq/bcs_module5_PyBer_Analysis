# An analysis of ride-sharing data in different city types

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to show the relationship between city types and various ride-sharing indices, in order to develop better strategy and deliver better ride-sharing service.

## Results

The data frame below showed the summary of ride sharing data from 2019-01-01 to 2019-05-08. The data showed that Pyber is the most popular in urban cities and the least popular in rural cities.  As shown in the data frame, urban, suburban and rural cities had 1625, 625 and 125 rides in total in that time period of time. Urban cities also had the highest number of drivers and the most fares, while rural cities had the least. Although urban cities had the most total fares, the average fare per ride in urban cities was lower than that for suburban and rural cities, and the rural cities had the highest average fare per ride. The average fare per driver had the same trend with the average fare per ride.  By comparing the total rides and total drivers, only urban cities had larger number of total drivers than total rides.

The multiple-line chart below showed the total fare of 3 types of cities from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29. From the beginning to the end of the time period, urban cities had the most total fare while the rural cities had the least. All of 3 types of cities had a peak of total fare in late February. The overall trend of the lines for urban and suburban cities were similar.

## Summary
1. The result showed that rural cities had the least number of rides and total fare but the most average fare per driver. So the drivers in rural cities have incentive to drive, in order to increase the total fares, Pyber can give some subsidy to riders for them to use the service more.
2. The result showed that the overall trend for total fare in suburban cities were similar to that for urban cities. So the promotion or advertising timeline could be designed similarly in those 2 types of cities.
3. The average fare per driver in urban cities were a lot lower than that for rural and suburban cities, since the total number of drivers was larger than total number of rides. The qualification of driver in urban cities could be set higher to keep the balance between demand and supply.
